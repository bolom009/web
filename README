Hi there :) in this repo you can see implemented custom http Handler with small wrappers:
- Context
- Error handler
- Middleware
    - Rate limiter

Note: I added examples folder where I wrote parser of the list of URLs, the main handler wrapped by rate 100/min, have a fun :)

How to setup:
- git clone https://github.com/bolom009/web.git
- cd to dir
- go mod tidy

How to run:
- go run examples/parser/main.go (send the request to http://localhost:8080 with body of urls and enjoy)
- go test ./... -coverprofile cover.out && go tool cover -html=cover.out (command for test coverage)

Erroneous situations:
1) For any parsers we should use proxy, als need to add more metadata for prevent ban (that's why in test not need to use prepared public urls)
2) For parsing sites need to set up context timeout for prevent request (don't see this case in description so I skipped it)
3) The list of URLs could be very long, so perhaps we need to use worker pool for controlling resources (the same, don't see the case)
